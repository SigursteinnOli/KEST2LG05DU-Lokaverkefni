We planed when we where going to do the project, met up and then got to work
We started setting up the virtual machine and gave it an ip address fairly easy.
Then we changed the host and domain name with no problem.
Our first problems started when we tried to setup the DHCP protocol. 
Something was wrong with the ip and some other things we did so we called our teacher Abdel for some insight.
After a little and well needed help we started creating the groups and users.
Now we where half-way done and called it a day

We woke up early and used Microsoft Teams to talk and share the project and continued where we left of.
