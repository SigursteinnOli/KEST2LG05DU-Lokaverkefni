We planned when we where going to do the project, met up and then got to work
We started setting up the virtual machine and gave it an ip address fairly easy.
Then we changed the host and domain name with no problem.
Our first problems started when we tried to setup the DHCP protocol. 
Something was wrong with the ip and some other things we did so we called our teacher Abdel for some insight.
After a little and well needed help we started creating the groups and users.
Now we were half-way done and called it a day

We woke up early and used Microsoft Teams to talk and share the project and continued where we left off.
We started by installing samba and created a empty share directory for IT and management to have control of.
After getting the permissions to work it was time to give them remote access via ssh.
we managed to figure that out and started working on the apache server.
It started well and the apache server was running but then we ran into problems that we couldn't figure out.
